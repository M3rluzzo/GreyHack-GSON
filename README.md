# 🎵 GSON for GreyScript - ThreeDog Edition! 🎵

*"Good evening, brave netland grey-hackers! This is ThreeDog pushing live from my bunker, and boy do I have some INCREDIBLE news for you today!"*

---

## 📻 ThreeDog's Message to the Netlands

*"Listen up, digital warriors! Some lowlife named ETAGamer tried to frame me with his malicious code - but ThreeDog doesn't back down from ANYONE!*

*This GSON module is CLEAN code, battle-tested, and verified. It's my revenge against those who try to destroy the reputation of freedom fighters!*

*Because remember, out there in the code netland: THE TRUTH ALWAYS COMES OUT!"* 🎯

**What does GSON actually do?** It saves your GreyScript data to files and loads them back - think of it like a save game system for your scripts! Instead of losing all your bot configurations, user lists, or collected data when your script stops, GSON keeps everything safe in files.

**Why should I care?** Because nobody wants to manually type in 100 IP addresses every time they restart their scanner! Save your progress, load your configs, and keep your digital life organized. Plus, unlike that corporate JSON garbage, GSON actually speaks GreyScript properly.

**How easy is it?** Two lines: `data.save("myfile.gson")` to save, `data = GSON.load("myfile.gson")` to load. That's it! ThreeDog guarantees it's easier than finding clean water in the netland.

## 🌟 What Makes This Special

**100% Clean Code** - No malware, no backdoors, no bullshit. Just pure, tested functionality.

**GSON Format** - Adapted for GreyScript with single quotes and numeric booleans

**Performance Beast** - Fast as a bullet in the netland

**Complete Testing** - 53/53 tests passed, just like ThreeDog likes it!

## ⚡ Quick Start - Put Your Headphones On!

```greyscript
import_code("gson")

// create your data - the ThreeDog way!
config = GSON_OBJECT.New()
config.Set("callsign", "ThreeDog")
config.Set("frequency", 101.1) 
config.Set("signal_strong", 1)  // hell yeah!

// OR use it like a regular map - your choice, freedom fighter!
config["backup_frequency"] = 99.9
config["listeners"] = 1337

// check what type we're dealing with
print("Data type: " + TypeOf(config))  // outputs: gsonobject

// get your data back - multiple ways because options are good!
callsign = config.Get("callsign")        // the clean way
frequency = config["frequency"]          // the direct way
has_backup = config.Has("backup_frequency")  // check if exists

// stringify for transmission across the netland
broadcast = GSON.Stringify(config, 1)  // pretty formatted
compact = GSON.Stringify(config)       // compact for transmission
print(broadcast)  // broadcast to the resistance!
```

## 🎯 Why GSON and Not That Corporate Crap?

Listen up, netland dwellers! There's corporate JSON garbage out there, written by suits who don't know clean code from a hole in the ground.

**GSON is different:**
- ✅ Written with passion, not malice
- ✅ Open source and transparent
- ✅ **TypeOf detection integration** - knows GSON objects from regular maps
- ✅ **Dual access patterns** - use `.Get()/.Set()` OR direct `[key]` access
- ✅ **Like the parent..** - So the Kiddo. I mean, the child. You can still use functions like "indexes" from regular map object
- ✅ **Freedom of choice** - because real netland survivors deserve options!
- ✅ ThreeDog personality guaranteed

## 🎮 What is GSON?

GSON (GreyScript Serialized Object Notation) is like JSON's cooler brother who actually understands GreyScript. While JSON speaks corporate, GSON speaks netland:

- Uses `'single quotes'` instead of `"double quotes"` 
- Represents booleans as `1` (true) and `0` (false)
- Perfect for data exchange in the the netlands
- Zero tolerance for malicious code

*"It's the data format the netland deserves - with the flexibility corporate JSON wishes it had!"* - ThreeDog

## 🛠️ Advanced Features - For Real Freedom Fighters

### Smart Object Detection
```greyscript
// GSON knows what it's dealing with
regular_map = {"key": "value"}
gson_obj = GSON_OBJECT.New({"key": "value"})

print(TypeOf(regular_map))  // "map"
print(TypeOf(gson_obj))     // "gsonobject" - ThreeDog's special sauce!
```

### Dual Access Patterns - Your Choice, Your Way
```greyscript
// Method 1: Clean and explicit (recommended for clean code)
data = GSON_OBJECT.New()
data.Set("station", "Galaxy News Radio")
callsign = data.Get("station")
if data.Has("backup") then print("Backup ready!")

// Method 2: Direct access (for quick and dirty operations)
data["listeners"] = 9999
data["power"] = "MAXIMUM"
current_power = data["power"]

// Mix and match - because freedom means choices!
data.Set("message", "Stay strong, netland!")
broadcast_reach = data["listeners"] * data.Get("power_multiplier", 1.5)
```

### Power User Tips
```greyscript
// Get all available keys
all_frequencies = data.indexes()

// Safe defaults when data might be missing
backup_freq = data.Get("backup", 98.5)  // returns 98.5 if "backup" not found

// TypeOf works everywhere for smart code
if TypeOf(incoming_data) == "gsonobject" then
    print("Received resistance data package!")
else
    print("Standard netland transmission")
end if
```
